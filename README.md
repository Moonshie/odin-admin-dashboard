# Project: Admin Dashboard
This is my final project for the Intermediate HTML and CSS Course.
While the assignments says not to worry about responsiveness, I'm eager to try and see if I can make this design work on any screen size, and specifically on mobile.

The project is finished. It's been a fun experience and I'm pleased with how it works on mobile.
